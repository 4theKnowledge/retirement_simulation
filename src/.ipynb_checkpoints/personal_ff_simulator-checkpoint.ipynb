A user profile can have the previously defined classes attributed to it e.g. income, expenses, savings, tax, superannuations, and asset value. A user profile is simulated over a lifetime, the lifetime is split into two phases 1. working, and 2. retirement. In the first phase, working, the user typically would take out loans, have income, commit to superannuation, etc. In the second phase, retirement, the income streams change, superannuation starts to be drawn down, etc. Parameters of the user profile include 1. name, 2. age, 3. expected retirement age (will be an output rather than an input in the future), and 4. expected age of death (assumed from health statistics based on gender; could be extended based on other salient factors)."
